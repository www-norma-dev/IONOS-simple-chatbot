# IONOS Agent Starter Pack

A full‑stack intelligent agent powered by LangGraph ReAct architecture and IONOS AI Models Hub. It features dynamic web search, context-aware reasoning, and an extensible tool system for building production-ready AI assistants.

## What's inside
- Backend: FastAPI service with a LangGraph ReAct agent (`backend/`).
- Frontends: Next.js starter and Streamlit app (`frontends/`).
- Docs: MDX documentation site (`docs/`).

## Features
- Chat with IONOS‑hosted models via a simple HTTP API.
- Tools: real-time web search (Tavily) and adaptive context retrieval.
- ReAct Agent: reasoning and acting with dynamic tool selection.
- Easy to add your own tools and extend agent capabilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- IONOS_API_KEY (required)
- TAVILY_API_KEY (required for web search functionality)

## Quickstart
1) Backend: follow the Windows‑friendly steps in [Backend Setup](/docs/backend/setup).
2) Choose a frontend:
	- [Next.js Setup](/docs/frontend/nextjs/setup)
	- [Streamlit Overview](/docs/frontend/streamlit)
3) Send a chat request with header `x-model-id` (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct`).

## How it works
The client sends messages to FastAPI → the ReAct agent reasons about the request → tools are called dynamically as needed (e.g., `web_search` for real-time information) → the model produces a context-aware final answer.
